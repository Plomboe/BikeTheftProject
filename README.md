# Bike Theft Project

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-5da6lq)

For this project, we used a large set of data to help us figure out the best practices to follow in order to have a better chance of a bike not being stolen. We used a dataset that was collected from the police department over the past 4 years on stolen bikes in Toronto. We came up with a model that is going to check the status of the bike which will tell us whether the bike will be stolen at a certain time and a specific location depending on the season, week, bike type, and/or premise. Some problems we ran into when working on trying to solve this dataset was the overwhelming amount of unfinished columns and we had to decide which ones to drop and which ones to keep. There were also missing data in the dataset, so we had to deal with that as well. Since there was a lot of data in this dataset, we decided to group the column’s objects so we could limit the objects and have an easier time filtering out the information.
